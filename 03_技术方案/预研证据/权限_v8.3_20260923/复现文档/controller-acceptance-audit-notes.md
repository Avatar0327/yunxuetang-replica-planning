# Controller acceptance audit notes

This file is a coverage audit, not an implemented/accepted matrix. Full source authority is04§9.4 and the168-subcase manifest.

- Recompute actual/expected observation JSON independently; raw IDs alone are not proof. Core old AUTH-T14-03 is an acting-account disable observation, not target-person state filtering.
- AUTH-T06 requires real browser navigation and route/error output, in addition to HTTP/data/source assertions. Preserve P/Q transitions and a separate lawful role.
- AUTH-T15 must demonstrate two different processes, pre-revocation old caches, and next-request/media after a completed revoke acknowledgment. PubSub absence is intentionally injected, not assumed cache delivery. State timestamp precision explicitly.
- AUTH-T16 cold and warm Redis failures, timeout and recovery, plus authoritative DB failure; every protected path rejects without data and no DB fallback. Permission failures cannot contribute to normal list/query timing.
- AUTH-T18 exact actual counts and resource caps, stable source image label,50 total concurrent clients600seconds, separate per-scenario/cache/candidate histograms, all raw samples; complete real list/count/aggregate SQL plans. Simplified core EXPLAIN is diagnostic only.
- AUTH-T19 needs ordered conflicting operations, including waiting-write after actor/company change (corefix1) and forthcoming batch/delegation/download paths; a sequential next-call test alone is not the contention test.
- AUTH-T20/24 selected management membership and provenance caps, role-level policy fanout preserving membership-local overrides, deletion/recreation identities, freeze/recheck. Distinguish source changes from membership creation.
- AUTH-T21/22/23 customersA/B/internal non-super all exercised, not onlyfixtureZ; shared content vs personal data; immutable historicalcompany; restricted selfwallet exception; no crosscompany offset/source references.
- Full53 product AC scenarios are not completed by24 permission AUTH groups. G01/G02/G04/G05/G06 stay permanent; no fabricated human recitation or signature.
- Core original review was interrupted by an automatic safety flag after two confirmed findings; read-only continuation subsequently accepted the boundedcore after6f1e75a. Preserve both history and actual finalreview limits.

- Core constrained workloads3people/1fact do not establish most-complex-range performance. Reference constrained workloads must include >=10000 resolvedpeople, multiple role-local sources/overrides and a partialcompany cap. Keep independent fixture arithmetic oracle; do not hide expensive scopes behind ALL or smallSELF.

## Browser campaign after fixtures stabilize

Use real browser and local Vue/ElementPlus shell, never infer rendered behavior from source. Select fixtureL before appointments: learner heading/no training management. GrantP through authorized test command, refresh: backend heading/training only/listP; openP successfully, inspect unauthorizedQ and other-module navigation through the businessUI route. GrantQ, revokeP:Q retained/P next request denied. RevokeLast:backend closed. Repeat with a lawful role retained. Capture safe empty/error copy and no SQL/stack/target person names. UI screenshots/snapshots + server request evidence are complementary, not substitutes. If a deep link/denial business route is absent, add the minimal prototype navigation before claiming browser coverage. New knowledge/role nodes must not all be mislabeled learningreports in the synthetic shell.

## Database commit timeline precision

Controller has prepared `tools/enable-commit-timestamps.sh` for an exclusive transition between Task4 and Task5. Do not run while another campaign owns the synthetic DB/APIs. It records before/restart/after; `capture-runtime.sh` records the resulting PG setting for all reference windows. After it is actually enabled, a sole-writer revoke campaign can record the authority revision row's `xmin` and `pg_xact_commit_timestamp(xmin)` alongside revision and A/B HTTP/request/response times. Check the observed transaction matches that revocation; do not label a later unrelated transaction as the revoke commit. Older runs without this setting retain their honest HTTP acknowledgment upper bound, not retroactive exact timestamps.

## Transferred project participants (named semantic audit)

Approved02:266 keeps enrollment/round data_company immutable, approved03:112 uses currentcompany for personnellists and storedcompany for learning/reportfacts, and04§5 applies currentauthorization before historicalgrouping. Task4roster filters storedroster.company_id and joins currentpersonprojection displayname. In Task5/export and finalreview, explicitly inspect transferred-person roster/progress/attachment/export behavior, what currentperson relationship defines this node, and whether currentprofilefields leak through an oldenrollment. Do not move oldenrollmentcompany to make tests pass or assume oldrecords must disappear. Record source-grounded node semantics; any actualunresolvedbusinessconflict remainsNoGo rather than a silentnewrule. This is an auditquestion, not a confirmeddefect.

Controller source resolution:03:193 classifies project/enrollments as enrollmentfacts;02:250 binds immutablepersonsnapshot;02:133/141 includes immutable displayname. Task5mustpreservestoredcompany andreplace currentprofileprojection withcaptured enrollmentname inroster/search/export. Newcompany mustnotgain oldenrollment bycurrentcompany-onlyfilter. Currentpersonmaster remainsseparate. Verifythisimplementation andtransfertests; no semanticacceptanceinferredfrom thisnote.

Task5 realfault campaign observed ColimaDBclock ahead ofhost byabout150–200ms; rawcrossclockcommit/request comparison failed despite protectedprobes behavingcorrectly. Preservebothclocks, sameDBclock commit+authoritative-read revision, hostrequest-after-ack causality, and measuredroundtrip clockbracket. Do notadjustsystemclocks or relabelHTTPack asDBcommit. tools/capture-clock-bracket.py adds read-only referenceenvironment provenance; no testresultinferred.
